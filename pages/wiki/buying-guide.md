So, you want to buy a watch that's already supported by AsteroidOS.
# General considerations
Your first instinct might be to choose the watch with the best technical specs - this isn't the best approach. Most WearOS watches have fairly comparable internals - the main differences are as follows:
- RAM: Older and lower-end watches have 512MB of ram, newer ones have 1GB and some have 768MB. AsteroidOS generally doesn't suffer from smaller amounts of RAM, so this only matters if you've got a unique usecase or are planning to use it as a dev machine.
- Storage: Most watches have 4GB. Some really new watches have up to 8GB. Keep in mind that the storage labelled on the tin is not the amount of storage you're actually going to get because we keep the stock android partition map.
- SOC: Currently the options are the Snapdragon 400 (a smartphone SOC), the Snapdragon Wear 2100 (a cut-down smartphone SOC built for watches) and the Snapdragon Wear 3100 (a Wear 2100 with slightly better battery life thanks to an additional CPU core). These all perform very comparably, with the later chips getting mildly better battery life and SD400 having a slightly better GPU.
Another thing to consider is that _watches don't get worse with age_. The software demands of WearOS did increase, but due to how efficient AsteroidOS is, you've got nothing to worry about, with nearly all watches giving the same smooth experience.
What you should actually look at:
Aesthetics: All smartwatches look very different, and some older watches have far more attractive designs than some newer ones.
Round or square: Both display types are very well designed for, but some round displays have quirks such as the flat tire on carp/smelt and minnow.
Materials: Some watches have metal casings, some have plastic, some have composite. Metal watches are heavier and feel higher quality. Plastic watches show fewer scratches but some suffer from structural issues. Choose whatever you think will feel and look best. Another thing to consider is the display material - some watches have sapphire displays, which are very hard to scratch, and so look far better as they age.
Display: Most watches have an adequate display resolution, but some (such as dory) haven't aged so well. Another thing to consider is the display technology: Most watches are OLED, which is fairly battery efficient but isn't very readable in bright sunlight and suffers from burn-in. LCDs are generally power hungry and not very common, but sportcarp and tetra have LCDs that can turn off their backlight to be readable in all lighting conditions and draw little power when doing so. Some watches, such as catfish and narwhal have unique display quicks which are worth looking into.
Sensors and peripherals: Depending on what you do with your watch, you might want to have sensors such as heartrate or a compass or even GPS. Some watches come with speakers, and these could be used for taking phone calls. Some watches come
with cellular connectivity, which would let you use them completely independently from a phone, but further development is needed for this to actually be viable.
Repairability: Some watches are harder to open than others, and some have very few parts available to buy. Watches that are glued shut will be harder to open and will lose water resistance after you open them, while watches sealed with a gasket will retain water resistance. Older watches are generally easier to open than newer ones, but see the repair section in the wiki for each watch to see the process. Keep in mind that the batteries are generally worn out on older watches, so expect to have to replace the battery yourself if buying an unrefurbished used model.
