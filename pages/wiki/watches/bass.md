Bass (LG Watch Urbane) is a large round steel watch that is very well supported. It has a lot in commmon with Lenok, but looks far more conventional so is an easy recommendation.
Warning: The LG Watch Urbane 2nd edition is not a variant of bass and is actually a completely separate watch, which is not currently supported by AsteroidOS. If you have one, please contact us on matrix and see the porting guide.

# Description
Bass is a fairly large steel-cased watch with a heartrate and pedometer sensor. It is very similar to lenok (LG G Watch R), but lacks a compass, looks far more conventional and is held together with glue instead of screws. The display is surrounded by a raised bezel that can make inputs near the edge somewhat unreliable. The watch seems to be available only in a steel and rare gold variant, and all bass take 22mm straps.

# Repair and customisation
The back of the watch is held on by glue, which means that disassembly will impact water resistance and is somewhat frustrating. Parts are commonly available. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Manually getting to fastboot
During the first seconds of the boot process, swipe diagonally across the screen. Starting from the top/left outer edge of the screen to the bottom/right.
