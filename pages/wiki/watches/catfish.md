# Description
The Catfish series are all fairly large watches with composite cases and two non-rotating buttons. Along with their interesting secondary FSTN LCD used for timekeeping when the watch display is off (or even when the whole watch is shut down!) they have a very complete set of features. They all come with heartrate, GPS, step counting and a speaker (useful for making phone calls) and catshark even comes with cellular connectivity which should enable complete independence from a phone. While catfish and catfish-ext get very respectable battery life of up to 3 days, catshark seems to have serious battery issues thanks to the modem and will generally barely last a day.
