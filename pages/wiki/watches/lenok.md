Lenok (LG G Watch R) is a large round black steel watch that is very well supported. It has a lot in commmon with Bass, but is easier to repair so is an easy recommendation.
Warning: dory (LG G Watch) and lenok (LG G Watch R) are confusingly named but are two entirely different watches.

# Description
Lenok is a fairly large steel-cased watch with an angular design. It includes a heartrate, compass and pedometer sensor. It is very similar to bass (LG Watch Urbane), but adds a compass, looks far less conventional and is held together with screws instead of glue. The watch seems to be available only in a black steel design, and all lenok take 22mm straps.

# Repair and customisation
The back of the watch is held on by screws, but there is a fragile gasket adhered to the back panel which you will need to be careful with. Parts are commonly available. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.
