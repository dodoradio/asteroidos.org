Hands
The defining feature of this watch is the pair of hands placed between the LCD and the touch sensitive glass. They are somewhat independent from the watch and will continue to tell the time without the system being booted (advertised battery life of this mode is up to 100 days). They may occasionally become misaligned with the display and will then require calibration.
The hands can be set to a certain position by the system, which they will hold until they recieve another command. The hands can also be set to 'watch mode', which will make them tell the time independently from the watch. If the watch shuts down due to low battery, the hands will continue to tell the time for more than a week. They will eventually also shut down in order to prevent overdischarging of the battery.
The qml module org.asteroid.controls provides the item PhysicalHands which allows easy control of the hands from QML applications.

Testing notes
Visually, the watch is quite large and the screen looks very small (partially due to being quite far down inside the casing). The watch comes with a silicone sports strap which rather spoils the look, and is quite inappropriate given that it has neither gps nor a heartrate sensor. Navigating the interface is quite enjoyable thanks to the comfortable crown. Obviously it is not a sport watch, but makes for quite an interesting conversation starter and the hands remain readable in bright lighting conditions, unlike many displays. Despite the problematic hardware, the unique hands make this watch really cool.
