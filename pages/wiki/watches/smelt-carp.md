Smelt (Moto 360 gen 2 46mm), carp (42mm) and sportcarp (Moto 360 sport) are a series of round watches with flat-tire LCD displays. A plastic ring must be removed to expose USB pads, but this doesn't compromise water resistance.

# Description
Smelt and carp are round steel-cased watches with a fully glass front and one button. They have a 'flat tire' display, where the bottom section is cut off and houses a brightness sensor. The display is a backlit LCD, so using it with Always on display is not recommended as power draw gets quite high. The watches charge wirelessly. Smelt takes a 22mm strap, carp has two variants, the 'mens/default' version taking 20mm straps and the women's version taking 16mm straps. The default straps for smelt and carp are really nice, with a selection of steel bracelets and high-quality leather.

## Moto 360 sport
The moto 360 sport (nicknamed sportcarp to differentiate but formally also codenamed carp) is an interesting variant of carp that comes with the addition of GPS, a transflective display and a rubber unibody case with non-removable straps. The transflective display is a variant of an LCD that does not need a constant backlight, so is readable when the backlight is off and even in sunlight. The unibody rubber case is bulkier than the metal case of standard carp, and the straps are known to crack with use. Replacement rubber casings aren't common, but the

# Getting USB
USB is exposed via a set of 4 metal contacts hidden under a plastic ring on the back of the watch. Removing only this ring won't comporomise water resistance. The ring should be quite easy to remove with just a spudger or knife and no heat - if you encounter significant resistance, check you're not trying to slice off the back glass.
The layouts on smelt and carp are different. It is recommended to print a dock to make use of these pins or to use some clips.

# Case mod
This mod, referred to as carpbomination, replaces the rubber casing of sportcarp with the metal casing of carp.
The rubber casings on sportcarp are known to crack with use and replacement casings are uncommon. This mod gives you the benefits of a sportcarp (GPS and daylight readable display) in the casing of a normal carp.
You will need the casing from a carp, the power buttton from either sportcarp or carp and the internal body of a sportcarp.
The body of the watch inside the casing is actually the same as a standard carp. You should be able to swap into any 42mm case, even the women's variant with 16mm lugs.
After going through the process of removing the power button from both watches, the internals can be removed by rotating clockwise and pushing the entire body out from the back. Once this is done, just swap the sportcarp internal 'puck' into the normal carp body and reverse the disassembly steps, rotating the body and then replacing the power button.

# Repair
The disassembly process of these watches is really wild but thankfully there is no glue involved. It is recommended to take a look at the iFixit guide and some videos to gain a good understanding. Beware that the display ribbon cable is fragile when opening the two halves of the watch. Batteries are available as FW3L for smelt and FW3S for all versions of carp and are fairly common. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Getting to fastboot
Keep holding the power button during the boot process and release it quickly after the third vibration.
