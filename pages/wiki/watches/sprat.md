# Description
Sprat is a medium-size watch with a square OLED display and a steel front casing. There are some subtle differences compared to dory, including the addition of a heartrate sensor, a power button and the brighter OLED display. The back of the watch curves and the 22mm straps are replaceable.

# Repair
The back of the watch is held on by 4 Torx T5 screws, and water resistance is achieved with a gasket, so repairs are easy. Parts are available. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Keys
Sprat's single key is the power button.
## Manually getting to fastboot
During the first seconds of the boot process, swipe diagonally across the screen. Starting from the top/left outer edge of the screen to the bottom/right.
