Dory (LG G watch) is a medium-sized rectangular watch and is the first watch to run Android Wear. The display has not aged particularly well, but the port is very complete.
Warning: dory (LG G Watch) and lenok (LG G Watch R) are confusingly named but are two entirely different watches.

# Description
Dory is a fairly simple rectangular watch with a compass. The display is an LCD with a low resolution, making it neither power efficient nor nice to look at. All dory take 22mm straps.

# Repair and customisation
The back of the watch is held on by screws, so repairs are easy. Parts are commonly available. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Manually getting to fastboot
During the first seconds of the boot process, swipe diagonally across the screen. Starting from the top/left outer edge of the screen to the bottom/right.
