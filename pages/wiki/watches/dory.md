Dory (LG G watch) is a medium-sized rectangular watch and is one of the first two watches to run Android Wear. The display has not aged particularly well, but the port is very complete.
Warning: dory (LG G Watch) and lenok (LG G Watch R) are confusingly named but are two entirely different watches.

# Description
Dory is a fairly simple rectangular watch with a compass. The watch lacks any external buttons, so all interaction is done through the touchscreen. The display is an LCD with a low resolution, making it neither power efficient nor nice to look at. All dory take 22mm straps.

# Repair
The back of the watch is held on by 4 Torx T5 screws, and water resistance is achieved with a gasket, so repairs are easy. Parts are available. You will likely need to replace the battery when buying these watches as they are getting quite old.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Keys
Dory has a 'reset button' accessible by sticking a pin through a hole in the back. This key is exactly the same as the main power button on any other watch.
## Manually getting to fastboot
During the first seconds of the boot process, swipe diagonally across the screen. Starting from the top/left outer edge of the screen to the bottom/right.
