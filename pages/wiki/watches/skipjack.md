# Description
Skipjack are round-screened OLED watches which all come with GPS, compass and easily accessible USB. Despite their shared innards, they have significant external differences. Unlike Catfish, these have no speaker.
## C2 and C2+
Both of these are compact watches with steel cases. Both the C2 and C2+ come in 18 and 20mm strap variants. The straps are easily replaceable. The C2+ seems to just be a ram upgrade to 1GB over the standard C2's 512mb. This doesn't have a measurable performance impact on AsteroidOS.
## S2
The S2 trades the metal case of the C2 for a larger plastic case with a metal back. Unlike the C2, there is also only one button.

# Repair
## C2 and C2+
These are held together with glue. Opening will compromise water resistance. Parts are not generally available
## S2
These are 4 torx screws on the back, but it is not known whether water is kept out with a glue layer (such as on TicWatch Pro 3) or a rubber o-ring (such as on previous Mobvoi models). Parts are not generally available.

# Miscellaneous hardware docs
## Keys
C2/C2+: The upper key is the power key.
S2: The only key is the power key.
## Manually getting to fastboot
C2/C2+: Power down the watch. Keep holding both buttons during the boot process until the fastboot menu appears.
S2: After the watch stops vibrating on startup, immediately touch the top left & bottom right edges of the screen. Tapping repeatedly after pressing the central power key may be useful.
