# Description
Mooneye are watches with OLED displays and GPS built in. They are obviously targetted at a more budget market with their plastic construction and MediaTek SOCs.
## TicWatch E
The watch has a hard plastic shell, with an angular design. Some variants come with translucent case elements. The straps can be replaced with any 20mm strap.
## TicWatch S
The top case is made out of hard plastic, while the strap is made of a softer plastic. The strap contains GPS antennae, so customising them isn't feasible, but they aren't integrated with the case, so they should be replaceable if damaged.

# Repair
Both watches are held together with glue, so opening them will compromise water resistance. Parts are not commonly available.

## Manually getting to fastboot
